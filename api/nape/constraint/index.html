 * <br/><br/>
 * Internally this list is at present implemented as a linked list with
 * object pooled nodes and iterators with various fast paths made for
 * standard access patterns (For instance accessing successive elements
 * runs in constant time when using random access functions)
 * <br/><br/>
 * Iteration of this list can be done in various ways, but the preferred
 * way on all targets, is through use of the foreach function:
 * <pre>
 * list.foreach(function (obj) {
 * });
 * </pre>
 * This method is inlined so that in haxe no closure will need to be created.
 * <br/><br/>
 * In AS3, a closure would need to be created in general, so for performance
 * reasons you 'may' choose to use iteration as follows:
 * <pre>
 * for (var i:int = 0; i &lt; list.length; i++) {
 *     var obj:Constraint = list.at(i);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <br/>
 * NOTE: It is 'not' safe to modify a list whilst iterating over it.
 * If you wish to remove elements during an iteration you should use the
 * filter method, for example:
 * <pre>
 * list.filter(function (obj) {
 *     // operate on object.
 *     // ...
 *     return (false if you want object to be removed);
 * });
 * </pre>
 * <br/><br/>
 * In AS3, if you wish to avoid a closure generation, you can perform such
 * an iteration in a safe manner as follows:
 * <pre>
 * var i:int = 0;
 * while (i &lt; list.length) {
 *     var obj:Constraint = list.at(i);
 *     // operate on object.
 *     // ...
 *     if (should remove obj) {
 *         list.remove(obj);
 *         continue;
 *     }
 *     else i++;
 * }
 * </pre>
 * Or if you are always clearing the list entirely you could write:
 * <pre>
 * while (!list.empty()) {
 *     var obj:Constraint = list.pop();
 *     // operate on object.
 *     // ...
 * }

 * This joint is not designed to work when <code> jointMin = jointMax = 0 </code> and constraint is

 * <br/><br/>
 * The equation for this constraint could be written like:
 * <pre>
 *        0  = [dir.cross(delta)]  = 0
 * jointMin &lt;= [dor.dot  (delta)] &lt;= jointMax
 * </pre>
 * where:
 * <pre>
 * dir   = body1.localVectorToWorld(direction).unit();
 * delta = body2.localPointToWorld(anchor2).sub(body1.localPointToWorld(anchor1));
 * </pre>
 * This is a 2 dimensional constraint, and is (when at the limits) solved as a
 * block constraint for better stability. This is however not the most stable
 * of joint when chained and put under stress and is a rather rare case where
 * using a non-stiff joint can actually be more stable than
 * using a stiff one.
 * <br/><br/>
 * When <code> jointMin = jointMax </code>, it would be better to use a PivotJoint
 *instead with suitable
 * placed anchors.
 * <br/><br/>
 * The line segment is defined implicitly via the
 * <code>anchor1, direction, jointMin and jointMax</code> properties with end
 * points defined in local coordinate system of body1 like:
 * <pre>
 * start = anchor1.add(direction.unit().mul(jointMin))
 * end   = anchor1.add(direction.unit().mul(jointMax))
 * </pre>
 * The reason for this more general description of a line segment is that one or
 * both of jointMin, jointMax are permitted to be infinite and a line segment
 * defined with a start and end point is not sufficient to describe such lines.</p></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><a href="../../nape/constraint/MotorJoint.html">MotorJoint</a></td><td><p>MotorJoint constraining the angular velocities of two bodies

 * <br/><br/>
 * The equation for this constraint is:
 * <pre>
 * body2.localPointToWorld(anchor2) = body1.localPointToWorld(anchor1)
 * </pre>
 * You may view this constraint as being equal to the DistanceJoint constraint
 * when both its jointMin and jointMax are exactly 0 (In such a case a
 * DistanceJoint becomes degenerate). Compared to the DistanceJoint this is
 * a 2 dimensional constraint.</p></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><a href="../../nape/constraint/PulleyJoint.html">PulleyJoint</a></td><td><p>PulleyJoint limiting the weighted sum of distances between 2 pairs of 4 local anchor points of Bodies.
 * <br/><br/>
 * The equation for this constraint could be written like:
 * <pre>
 * jointMin &lt;= distance(body2.localPointToWorld(anchor2), body1.localPointToWorld(anchor1))
 *   + ratio * distance(body4.localPointToWorld(anchor4), body3.localPointToWorld(anchor3)) &lt;= jointMax
 * </pre>
 * This joint is not designed to work when either of these pairs achieves a distance of 0, it will still work
 * but may not be entirely ideal.

 * <br/><br/>
 * This API is intended to be powerful enough to model any constraint that
 * Nape can handle, but not so low level as to be completely prohibitive.
 * <br/>
 * For instance, things like soft-constraints are automatically provided
 * by this API.
 * <br/><br/>
 * Working with this API will require mathematical skills. A full manual
 * for this API is provided at: http://napephys.com/help/Constraints.pdf
 * <br/><br/>
 * You may also be interested in the nape-symbolic module that is available
 * on github/haxelib/nape downloads. Which provides a run-time compiled DSL
 * using this API to make prototyping (or creating non-performance critical)
 * user-defined constraints simple without the need for great mathematical
 * skills as well as being much quicker to work with.</p></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><a href="../../nape/constraint/WeldJoint.html">WeldJoint</a></td><td><p>WeldJoint constraining two bodies to be exactly locked together.
 * <br/><br/>
 * The equation for this constraint is:
 * <pre>
 * [ body2.localPointToWorld(anchor2) ] = [ body1.localPointToWorld(anchor1) ]
 * [          body2.rotation          ]   [      body1.rotation + phase      ]
 * </pre>
 * This constraint is equivalent to using a PivotJoint and AngleJoint
 * together except that it is solved as a single constraint and thus
 * will be more stable.
 * <br/><br/>
 * This constraint is 3 dimensional.
 * <br/><br/>
 * Although this constraint is very stable, if you chain bodies together
 * using this constraint, you should except to see a small amount of rotation
 * about the anchor points so you should chose them accordingly.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></body></html>
