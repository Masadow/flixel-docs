 * asynchronous operation to fail.
 <em>
 * <p>The ErrorEvent class defines only one type of <code>error</code> event:
 * <code>ErrorEvent.ERROR</code>. The ErrorEvent class also serves as the base
 * class for several other error event classes, including the AsyncErrorEvent,
 * IOErrorEvent, SecurityErrorEvent, SQLErrorEvent, and UncaughtErrorEvent
 * classes.</p></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><a href="../../flash/events/Event.html">Event</a></td><td><p>The Event class is used as the base class for the creation of Event
 * objects, which are passed as parameters to event listeners when an event
 * occurs.
 <em>
 * <p>The properties of the Event class carry basic information about an
 * event, such as the event's type or whether the event's default behavior can
 * be canceled. For many events, such as the events represented by the Event
 * class constants, this basic information is sufficient. Other events,
 * however, may require more detailed information. Events associated with a
 * mouse click, for example, need to include additional information about the
 * location of the click event and whether any keys were pressed during the
 * click event. You can pass such additional information to event listeners by
 * extending the Event class, which is what the MouseEvent class does.
 * ActionScript 3.0 API defines several Event subclasses for common events
 * that require additional information. Events associated with each of the
 * Event subclasses are described in the documentation for each class.</p></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><a href="../../flash/events/EventDispatcher.html">EventDispatcher</a></td><td><p>The EventDispatcher class is the base class for all classes that dispatch
 * events. The EventDispatcher class implements the IEventDispatcher interface
 * and is the base class for the DisplayObject class. The EventDispatcher
 * class allows any object on the display list to be an event target and as
 * such, to use the methods of the IEventDispatcher interface.
 <em>
 * <p>Event targets are an important part of the Flash<sup>®</sup> Player and
 * Adobe<sup>®</sup> AIR<sup>®</sup> event model. The event target serves as
 * the focal point for how events flow through the display list hierarchy.
 * When an event such as a mouse click or a keypress occurs, Flash Player or
 * the AIR application dispatches an event object into the event flow from the
 * root of the display list. The event object then makes its way through the
 * display list until it reaches the event target, at which point it begins
 * its return trip through the display list. This round-trip journey to the
 * event target is conceptually divided into three phases: the capture phase
 * comprises the journey from the root to the last node before the event
 * target's node, the target phase comprises only the event target node, and
 * the bubbling phase comprises any subsequent nodes encountered on the return
 * trip to the root of the display list.</p></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><a href="../../flash/events/EventPhase.html">EventPhase</a></td><td><p>The EventPhase class provides values for the <code>eventPhase</code>
 * property of the Event class.</p></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><a href="../../flash/events/FocusEvent.html">FocusEvent</a></td><td><p>An object dispatches a FocusEvent object when the user changes the focus
 * from one object in the display list to another. There are four types of
 * focus events:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><code>FocusEvent.FOCUS<em>IN</code></li>
 *   <li><code>FocusEvent.FOCUS</em>OUT</code></li>
 *   <li><code>FocusEvent.KEY<em>FOCUS</em>CHANGE</code></li>
 *   <li><code>FocusEvent.MOUSE<em>FOCUS</em>CHANGE</code></li>

 * operations to fail.
 *
 * <p>You can check for error events that do not have any listeners by using
 * the debugger version of Flash Player or the AIR Debug Launcher(ADL). The
 * string defined by the <code>text</code> parameter of the IOErrorEvent
 * constructor is displayed.</p></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><a href="../../flash/events/KeyboardEvent.html">KeyboardEvent</a></td><td><p>A KeyboardEvent object id dispatched in response to user input through a
 * keyboard. There are two types of keyboard events:
 * <code>KeyboardEvent.KEY<em>DOWN</code> and <code>KeyboardEvent.KEY</em>UP</code>
 <em>
 * <p>Because mappings between keys and specific characters vary by device and
 * operating system, use the TextEvent event type for processing character
 * input.</p></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><a href="../../flash/events/MouseEvent.html">MouseEvent</a></td><td><p>A MouseEvent object is dispatched into the event flow whenever mouse events
 * occur. A mouse event is usually generated by a user input device, such as a
 * mouse or a trackball, that uses a pointer.
 *
 * <p>When nested nodes are involved, mouse events target the deepest possible
 * nested node that is visible in the display list. This node is called the
 * <i>target node</i>. To have a target node's ancestor receive notification
 * of a mouse event, use <code>EventDispatcher.addEventListener()</code> on
 * the ancestor node with the <code>type</code> parameter set to the specific
 * mouse event you want to detect.</p></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><a href="../../flash/events/NetStatusEvent.html">NetStatusEvent</a></td><td><p></p></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><a href="../../flash/events/TextEvent.html">TextEvent</a></td><td><p>An object dispatches a TextEvent object when a user enters text in a text
 * field or clicks a hyperlink in an HTML-enabled text field. There are two
 * types of text events: <code>TextEvent.LINK</code> and
 * <code>TextEvent.TEXT_INPUT</code>.</p></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><a href="../../flash/events/TouchEvent.html">TouchEvent</a></td><td><p>The TouchEvent class lets you handle events on devices that detect user
 * contact with the device(such as a finger on a touch screen). When a user
 * interacts with a device such as a mobile phone or tablet with a touch
 * screen, the user typically touches the screen with his or her fingers or a
 * pointing device. You can develop applications that respond to basic touch
 * events(such as a single finger tap) with the TouchEvent class. Create
 * event listeners using the event types defined in this class. For user
 * interaction with multiple points of contact(such as several fingers moving
 * across a touch screen at the same time) use the related GestureEvent,
 * PressAndTapGestureEvent, and TransformGestureEvent classes. And, use the
 * properties and methods of these classes to construct event handlers that
 * respond to the user touching the device.
 <em>
 * <p>Use the Multitouch class to determine the current environment's support
 * for touch interaction, and to manage the support of touch interaction if
 * the current environment supports it.</p></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><a href="../../flash/events/UncaughtErrorEvents.html">UncaughtErrorEvents</a></td><td><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></body></html>
