 * a user's computer or on a server. Shared objects offer real-time data
 * sharing between multiple client SWF files and objects that are persistent
 * on the local computer or remote server. Local shared objects are similar to
 * browser cookies and remote shared objects are similar to real-time data
 * transfer devices. To use remote shared objects, you need Adobe Flash Media
 * Server.
 <em>
 * <p>Use shared objects to do the following:</p>
 </em>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Maintain local persistence</b>. This is the simplest way to use a
 * shared object, and does not require Flash Media Server. For example, you
 * can call <code>SharedObject.getLocal()</code> to create a shared object in
 * an application, such as a calculator with memory. When the user closes the
 * calculator, Flash Player saves the last value in a shared object on the
 * user's computer. The next time the calculator is run, it contains the
 * values it had previously. Alternatively, if you set the shared object's
 * properties to <code>null</code> before the calculator application is
 * closed, the next time the application runs, it opens without any values.
 * Another example of maintaining local persistence is tracking user
 * preferences or other data for a complex website, such as a record of which
 * articles a user read on a news site. Tracking this information allows you
 * to display articles that have already been read differently from new,
 * unread articles. Storing this information on the user's computer reduces
 * server load.</li>
 *   <li><b>Store and share data on Flash Media Server</b>. A shared object
 * can store data on the server for other clients to retrieve. For example,
 * call <code>SharedObject.getRemote()</code> to create a remote shared
 * object, such as a phone list, that is persistent on the server. Whenever a
 * client makes changes to the shared object, the revised data is available to
 * all clients currently connected to the object or who later connect to it.
 * If the object is also persistent locally, and a client changes data while
 * not connected to the server, the data is copied to the remote shared object
 * the next time the client connects to the object.</li>
 *   <li><b>Share data in real time</b>. A shared object can share data among
 * multiple clients in real time. For example, you can open a remote shared
 * object that stores a list of users connected to a chat room that is visible
 * to all clients connected to the object. When a user enters or leaves the
 * chat room, the object is updated and all clients that are connected to the
 * object see the revised list of chat room users.</li>
 * </ul>
 <em>
 * <p> To create a local shared object, call
 * <code>SharedObject.getLocal()</code>. To create a remote shared object,
 * call <code>SharedObject.getRemote()</code>.</p>
 </em>
 * <p> When an application closes, shared objects are <i>flushed</i>, or
 * written to a disk. You can also call the <code>flush()</code> method to
 * explicitly write data to a disk.</p>
 <em>
 * <p><b>Local disk space considerations.</b> Local shared objects have some
 * limitations that are important to consider as you design your application.
 * Sometimes SWF files may not be allowed to write local shared objects, and
 * sometimes the data stored in local shared objects can be deleted without
 * your knowledge. Flash Player users can manage the disk space that is
 * available to individual domains or to all domains. When users decrease the
 * amount of disk space available, some local shared objects may be deleted.
 * Flash Player users also have privacy controls that can prevent third-party
 * domains(domains other than the domain in the current browser address bar)
 * from reading or writing local shared objects.</p>
 </em>
 * <p><b>Note</b>: SWF files that are stored and run on a local computer, not
 * from a remote server, can always write third-party shared objects to disk.
 * For more information about third-party shared objects, see the &lt;a
 * href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html"
 * scope="external">Global Storage Settings panel</a> in Flash Player
 * Help.</p>
 <em>
 * <p>It's a good idea to check for failures related to the amount of disk
 * space and to user privacy controls. Perform these checks when you call
 * <code>getLocal()</code> and <code>flush()</code>:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><code>SharedObject.getLocal()</code>  -  Flash Player throws an
 * exception when a call to this method fails, such as when the user has
 * disabled third-party shared objects and the domain of your SWF file does
 * not match the domain in the browser address bar.</li>
 *   <li><code>SharedObject.flush()</code>  -  Flash Player throws an
 * exception when a call to this method fails. It returns
 * <code>SharedObjectFlushStatus.FLUSHED</code> when it succeeds. It returns
 * <code>SharedObjectFlushStatus.PENDING</code> when additional storage space
 * is needed. Flash Player prompts the user to allow an increase in storage
 * space for locally saved information. Thereafter, the <code>netStatus</code>
 * event is dispatched with an information object indicating whether the flush
 * failed or succeeded.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 </em>
 * <p>If your SWF file attempts to create or modify local shared objects, make
 * sure that your SWF file is at least 215 pixels wide and at least 138 pixels
 * high(the minimum dimensions for displaying the dialog box that prompts
 * users to increase their local shared object storage limit). If your SWF
 * file is smaller than these dimensions and an increase in the storage limit
 * is required, <code>SharedObject.flush()</code> fails, returning
 * <code>SharedObjectFlushedStatus.PENDING</code> and dispatching the
 * <code>netStatus</code> event.</p>
 <em>
 * <p> <b>Remote shared objects.</b> With Flash Media Server, you can create
 * and use remote shared objects, that are shared in real-time by all clients
 * connected to your application. When one client changes a property of a
 * remote shared object, the property is changed for all connected clients.
 * You can use remote shared objects to synchronize clients, for example,
 * users in a multi-player game. </p>
 </em>
 * <p> Each remote shared object has a <code>data</code> property which is an
 * Object with properties that store data. Call <code>setProperty()</code> to
 * change an property of the data object. The server updates the properties,
 * dispatches a <code>sync</code> event, and sends the properties back to the
 * connected clients. </p>
 <em>
 * <p> You can choose to make remote shared objects persistent on the client,
 * the server, or both. By default, Flash Player saves locally persistent
 * remote shared objects up to 100K in size. When you try to save a larger
 * object, Flash Player displays the Local Storage dialog box, which lets the
 * user allow or deny local storage for the shared object. Make sure your
 * Stage size is at least 215 by 138 pixels; this is the minimum size Flash
 * requires to display the dialog box. </p>
 </em>
 * <p> If the user selects Allow, the server saves the shared object and
 * dispatches a <code>netStatus</code> event with a <code>code</code> property
 * of <code>SharedObject.Flush.Success</code>. If the user select Deny, the
 * server does not save the shared object and dispatches a
 * <code>netStatus</code> event with a <code>code</code> property of
 * <code>SharedObject.Flush.Failed</code>. </p>
 * 
 * @event asyncError Dispatched when an exception is thrown asynchronously  - 
 *                   that is, from native asynchronous code.
 * @event netStatus  Dispatched when a SharedObject instance is reporting its
 *                   status or error condition. The <code>netStatus</code>
 *                   event contains an <code>info</code> property, which is an
 *                   information object that contains specific information
 *                   about the event, such as whether a connection attempt
 *                   succeeded or whether the shared object was successfully
 *                   written to the local disk.
 * @event sync       Dispatched when a remote shared object has been updated
 *                   by the server.</p></div><h2>Class Fields</h2><div class="platform platform-flash"><a name="defaultObjectEncoding"></a><h3><p><code><span class="keyword">static </span><span class="keyword">var</span> <a href="#defaultObjectEncoding"><span class="identifier">defaultObjectEncoding</span></a>:<a class="type" href="../../UInt.html">UInt</a></code></p></h3><div class="doc"><p>The default object encoding(AMF version) for all local shared objects

 </em>
 * <p>The default value of <code>SharedObject.defaultObjectEncoding</code> is
 * set to use the ActionScript 3.0 format, AMF3. If you need to write local

 * available to the current client. If the shared object does not already
 * exist, this method creates one. If any values passed to
 * <code>getLocal()</code> are invalid or if the call fails, Flash Player
 * throws an exception.
 <em>
 * <p>The following code shows how you assign the returned shared object
 * reference to a variable:</p>
 </em>
 * <p><code>var so:SharedObject =
 * SharedObject.getLocal("savedData");</code></p>
 <em>
 * <p><b>Note:</b> If the user has chosen to never allow local storage for
 * this domain, the object is not saved locally, even if a value for
 * <code>localPath</code> is specified. The exception to this rule is local
 * content. Local content can always write shared objects from third-party
 * domains(domains other than the domain in the current browser address bar)
 * to disk, even if writing of third-party shared objects to disk is
 * disallowed. </p>
 </em>
 * <p>To avoid name conflicts, Flash looks at the location of the SWF file
 * creating the shared object. For example, if a SWF file at
 * www.myCompany.com/apps/stockwatcher.swf creates a shared object named
 * <code>portfolio</code>, that shared object does not conflict with another
 * object named <code>portfolio</code> that was created by a SWF file at
 * www.yourCompany.com/photoshoot.swf because the SWF files originate from
 * different directories. </p>
 <em>
 * <p>Although the <code>localPath</code> parameter is optional, you should
 * give some thought to its use, especially if other SWF files need to access
 * the shared object. If the data in the shared object is specific to one SWF
 * file that will not be moved to another location, then use of the default
 * value makes sense. If other SWF files need access to the shared object, or
 * if the SWF file that creates the shared object will later be moved, then
 * the value of this parameter affects how accessible the shared object will
 * be. For example, if you create a shared object with <code>localPath</code>
 * set to the default value of the full path to the SWF file, no other SWF
 * file can access that shared object. If you later move the original SWF
 * file to another location, not even that SWF file can access the data
 * already stored in the shared object.</p>
 </em>
 * <p>To avoid inadvertently restricting access to a shared object, use the
 * <code>localpath</code> parameter. The most permissive approach is to set
 * <code>localPath</code> to <code>/</code>(slash), which makes the shared
 * object available to all SWF files in the domain, but increases the
 * likelihood of name conflicts with other shared objects in the domain. A
 * more restrictive approach is to append <code>localPath</code> with folder
 * names that are in the full path to the SWF file. For example, for a
 * <code>portfolio</code> shared object created by the SWF file at
 * www.myCompany.com/apps/stockwatcher.swf, you could set the
 * <code>localPath</code> parameter to <code>/</code>, <code>/apps</code>, or
 * <code>/apps/stockwatcher.swf</code>. You must determine which approach
 * provides optimal flexibility for your application.</p>
 <em>
 * <p>When using this method, consider the following security model:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>You cannot access shared objects across sandbox boundaries.</li>
 *   <li>Users can restrict shared object access by using the Flash Player
 * Settings dialog box or the Settings Manager. By default, an application
 * can create shared objects of up 100 KB of data per domain. Administrators
 * and users can also place restrictions on the ability to write to the file
 * system.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 </em>
 * <p>Suppose you publish SWF file content to be played back as local files
 * (either locally installed SWF files or EXE files), and you need to access
 * a specific shared object from more than one local SWF file. In this
 * situation, be aware that for local files, two different locations might be
 * used to store shared objects. The domain that is used depends on the
 * security permissions granted to the local file that created the shared
 * object. Local files can have three different levels of permissions:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Access to the local filesystem only.</li>
 *   <li>Access to the network only.</li>
 *   <li>Access to both the network and the local filesystem.</li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 <em>
 * <p>Local files with access to the local filesystem(level 1 or 3) store
 * their shared objects in one location. Local files without access to the
 * local filesystem(level 2) store their shared objects in another
 * location.</p>
 </em>
 * <p>You can prevent a SWF file from using this method by setting the
 * <code>allowNetworking</code> parameter of the the <code>object</code> and
 * <code>embed</code> tags in the HTML page that contains the SWF
 * content.</p>

 * indicates which Action Message Format version should be used: the

 * (AMF0).
 <em>
 * <p>Object encoding is handled differently depending if the shared object

 </em>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Local shared objects</b>. You can get or set the value of the
 * <code>objectEncoding</code> property for local shared objects. The value
 * of <code>objectEncoding</code> affects what formatting is used for
 * <i>writing</i> this local shared object. If this local shared object must
 * be readable by ActionScript 2.0 or 1.0 SWF files, set
 * <code>objectEncoding</code> to <code>ObjectEncoding.AMF0</code>. Even if
 * object encoding is set to write AMF3, Flash Player can still read AMF0
 * local shared objects. That is, if you use the default value of this
 * property, <code>ObjectEncoding.AMF3</code>, your SWF file can still read
 * shared objects created by ActionScript 2.0 or 1.0 SWF files. </li>
 *   <li><b>Remote shared objects</b>. When connected to the server, a remote
 * shared object inherits its <code>objectEncoding</code> setting from the

 * remote shared object). When not connected to the server, a remote shared
 * object inherits the <code>defaultObjectEncoding</code> setting from the
 * associated NetConnection instance. Because the value of a remote shared
 * object's <code>objectEncoding</code> property is determined by the
 * NetConnection instance, this property is read-only for remote shared
 * objects. </li>
