Welcome to HaxeFlixel! You are on your way to using the best Game Development Framework (at least, in my opinion)!
In this series of tutorials, I will walk you through making a complete game in HaxeFlixel from start to finish, and
then some. Iâ€™ve broken down each step into smaller chunks to help you get through even the most complicated and
daunting steps.

I will gear these tutorials towards building on Flash, Windows, and Android (since those are the platforms I have access
to). We will work primarily with Flash most of the time.

We are going to be building a small dungeon crawler. You can see the finished product here:

If you have any questions, or get stuck during this tutorial, you can post on our
[community forums](http://haxeflixel.com/forum/), or in the #haxeflixel IRC channel on freenode.

This tutorial was written using HaxeFlixel version 3.3.0.

So let's go ahead and get started!
